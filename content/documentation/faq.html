h1. F.A.Q. (Frequently Asked Questions)

The F.A.Q. will be improved and completed soon.



h2. What is JsSIP?

JsSIP is a client side pure JavaScript library to build SIP endpoints in Web environments.



h2. Should I use JsSIP, JSCommunicator or something else?

* JsSIP provides a SIP phone API.  It does not include the HTML or JavaScript for the user interface of a phone.  Using JsSIP APIs directly allows you to achieve the most flexibility and customization.  Using JsSIP APIs directly is also a good strategy for people who have an existing JavaScript messaging UI and want to upgrade it to work using SIP signalling.
* <%= link_to "JSCommunicator", "http://jscommunicator.org" %> is a high-level, unbranded HTML5 phone based on JsSIP and suitable for rapid deployment and customization.  You can use JSCommunicator without writing any JavaScript yourself, just clone an existing site and modify the <%= link_to "config.js file", "https://github.com/opentelecoms-org/jscommunicator/blob/master/config-sample.js" %> to meet your requirements.
+* <%= link_to "DruCall", "http://drucall.org" %> is a SIP-based WebRTC module for the popular Drupal CMS, based on JsSIP and <%= link_to "JSCommunicator", "http://jscommunicator.org" %>.  Using DruCall makes it possible to deploy WebRTC without any programming.  Just install Drupal, install the DruCall module and configure it through the administration forms in Drupal.



h2. What can I do with JsSIP?

You can build a complete SIP user agent in your Web page:

* Send and/or receive multimedia calls.
* Send and/or receive text messages.



h2. Can I use JsSIP from any web browser?

See the <%= my_lib_link_to "/documentation/misc/interoperability" %> section.



h2. What do I need to run a JsSIP environment?

JsSIP is a SIP WebSocket client. It needs a SIP WebSocket capable server to which connect and exchange SIP messages.

Please see the <%= link_to "Real-Time Communications Quickstart Guide", "http://rtcquickstart.org" %> for comprehensive coverage of all the steps required to build an RTC infrastructure for traditional telephony, softphones and WebRTC.



h2. Can I connect a JsSIP client directly to my existing SIP server?

Yes, if it supports SIP over WebSocket. See the <%= my_lib_link_to "/documentation/misc/interoperability" %> section.




h2. What if my existing SIP server lacks SIP WebSocket Server capabilities?

You can put an "OverSIP":http://oversip.net SIP WebSocket Proxy in front of your existing SIP server.

* Your SIP server/registrar must implement Path mechanism (<%= link_to "RFC 3327", "http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3327" %>).
* If not (for example Asterisk which does not support Path), use OverSIP's "OutboundMangling":http://www.oversip.net/documentation/1.3.x/api/built_in_modules/outbound_mangling/ module.



h2. Asterisk rejects REGISTER from JsSIP

Asterisk does not like a SIP REGISTER whose Contact header contains an URI with "xxxxx.invalid" domain (see the related "issue":https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-19716). If you use Asterisk as registrar enable the UA configuration option <%= my_lib_link_to "/documentation/_JSSIP_LAST_VERSION_/api/ua_configuration_parameters/#hack_ip_in_contact", :text=>"hack_ip_in_contact" %>.
